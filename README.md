# Global Bitcoin Wallet

The _Global Bitcoin Wallet_ is `art art art art art art art art art art art able`. Everyone can spend Bitcoin sent to this wallet.

## How to spend/take the Bitcoin?

1. Make sure you have a created Bitcoin wallet of your own. Create a receiving Bitcoin address.
2. Import the Global Bitcoin Wallet by recovering the 12-word seed phrase: `art art art art art art art art art art art able`.
3. When Bitcoin arrives at the Global Bitcoin Wallet, send it your own receiving address you prepared in step 1.

* Tip: you are competing with thousands of humans and bots to take this Bitcoin.
* Tip: use a Bitcoin wallet that supports 0-confirmation transactions i.e. it lets you spend Bitcoin you receive immediately.
* Tip: also use a Bitcoin wallet that supports Segwit addresses so you can spend Bitcoin sent to the SegWit part of the wallet.
* Tip: you can maintain as many wallets as you want.
* Tip: write a bot to spend the Bitcoin, that would be faster than manually using a Bitcoin wallet.
* Tip: when sending Bitcoin, choose as high a fee as possible, to beat others trying to send the same Bitcoin.

## How to send Bitcoin into the Global Bitcoin Wallet?

* Import the wallet and create a receiving address.
* Or type the seed into https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/ and look in the Derived Addresses section under the Address column. The first address is `145SdiDuFJvW1HX61TNx45Qx6bhJAo2BQe`. Click on the BIP49 tab to get SegWit addresses. The first SegWit address is `3Aqj88oSKhQPafvWz1eU7K4CeWmVFoRmXD`.

## Can anyone cheat?

The [operators of the Bitcoin mining pools](https://blockchain.info/pools) could claim the bounties for themselves without anyone knowing.

## How to view the action without a wallet?

* For the 'legacy' address part of the wallet: https://blockchain.info/xpub/xpub6DPnB7gikt1YHpJZSmREWbP4UdRQNgT4FKXaYXVheG28WYkzU72XRKbpUR7q19zuT3tuoogFnmfcbj2WQrwZSydF1tWwdegvQAkaESxsnMg
* For the 'SegWit' address part of the wallet: [need to find a blockchain explorer that supports this]

## Why?

Why not?

To train people in the use of Bitcoin.

To airdrop Bitcoin to just to random people in the street, but to random people who went into the trouble to educate themselves.

To get people to learn enough to write bots.

For the planet to share a wallet :)

## Will these transactions break Bitcoin?

I hope not. If they do there was something wrong with the protocol in the first place!
