# Global Bitcoin Wallet

The _Global Bitcoin Wallet_ is `art art art art art art art art art art art able`. Everyone can spend Bitcoin sent to this wallet.

## How to spend/take the Bitcoin?

1. Make sure you have a created Bitcoin wallet of your own. Create a receiving Bitcoin address. Start at https://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started
2. Import the Global Bitcoin Wallet by recovering the 12-word seed phrase: `art art art art art art art art art art art able`.
3. When Bitcoin arrives at the Global Bitcoin Wallet, send it your own receiving address you prepared in step 1.

* Tip: you are competing with thousands of humans and bots to take this Bitcoin.
* Tip: use a Bitcoin wallet that supports 0-confirmation transactions i.e. it lets you spend Bitcoin you receive immediately.
* Tip: also use a Bitcoin wallet that supports Segwit addresses so you can spend Bitcoin sent to the SegWit part of the wallet.
* Tip: you can maintain as many wallets as you want.
* Tip: write a bot to spend the Bitcoin, that would be faster than manually using a Bitcoin wallet.
* Tip: when sending Bitcoin, choose as high a fee as possible, to beat others trying to send the same Bitcoin.

## How to send Bitcoin into the Global Bitcoin Wallet?

* Import the wallet and create a receiving address.
* Or type the seed into https://iancoleman.github.io/bip39/ and look in the Derived Addresses section under the Address column. The first address is `145SdiDuFJvW1HX61TNx45Qx6bhJAo2BQe`. Click on the BIP49 tab to get SegWit addresses. The first SegWit address is `3Aqj88oSKhQPafvWz1eU7K4CeWmVFoRmXD`.

## Can anyone cheat?

The [operators of the Bitcoin mining pools](https://blockchain.info/pools) could claim the bounties for themselves without anyone knowing. But as long as people keep trying to take the bounties (we can measure this), this project achieves its educational purpose.

## How to view the action?

* Just import the seed into your wallet and watch.
* Without a wallet, you can see the non-SegWit transactions at: https://blockchain.info/xpub/xpub6DPnB7gikt1YHpJZSmREWbP4UdRQNgT4FKXaYXVheG28WYkzU72XRKbpUR7q19zuT3tuoogFnmfcbj2WQrwZSydF1tWwdegvQAkaESxsnMg
* Without a wallet, you can see the SegWit transactions at: [need to find a blockchain explorer that supports this]

## Why?

Why not?

This is a learning exercise in:
* Bitcoin
* Bitcoin Hierarchical Deterministic wallets, BIP39 seeds and BIP44 & BIP49 derivation paths
* Bitcoin transactions
* Spending unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction outputs
* Bitcoin fees
* RBF (Replace By Fee)
* CPFP (Child Pays For Parent)
* Scripting
* Bitcoin scripting

To randomly donate Bitcoin to **people who went into the trouble to educate themselves**; not just random people off the street.

For the planet to share a wallet :)

## Will these transactions break Bitcoin?

I hope not. If they do there was something wrong with the protocol in the first place!
